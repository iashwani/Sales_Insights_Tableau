### Project â€“ Created "Tableau Dashboard" to get company sales information

This project helps to understand the sales insights of a hardware company that sells millions of products every year. We have created two dashboards to check the total sales and profit pattern across the country.

### We can analysis following particulars through the dashboard.

#### Dashboard 1 - Revenue Analysis

2.	Total profit of the company
3.	Revenue by market
4.	Profit margin by market
5.	Profit margin by year and month
6.	Customer Type
7.	Customer Table that provide details of total sales with profit at one place.

#### Dashboard 2- Profit Analysis

1.	Total sales of revenue of the company
2.	Total sales of products of the company
3.	Revenue by market
4.	Sales of product by market
5.	Top 5 Customers by revenue 
6.	Top 5 products by revenue
7.	Revenue by year 

**We can easily filter all details in yearly and monthly basis.** 

#### Tools that I have used:
**Tableau Desktop 2021.1, Tableau Public 2021.1, MYSQL Workbench 8.0**
I have fetched data from **MySQL server** and did some manipulation like: **Handled missing value, normalized sales amount and created some new columns as per the project requirements.**
